Deployment Process

Deployment was performed using Docker and Docker Compose.

Deployment steps included:
- Pulling required container images
- Starting services using Docker Compose
- Verifying container status and logs
- Confirming service accessibility through exposed ports

Standardized deployment steps reduced manual effort
and ensured consistent environments across deployments.
